<h2>The INTERFACEENUM Sample</h2>

<p>The INTERFACEENUM Sample accompanies Chapter 2 and illustrates how to locate
the devices that support particular interfaces. This sample was part of Service
Pack 5 in the 1st edition.</p>

<p>The sample includes one component:</p>

<ul>
<li>InterfaceEnum.EXE is a console-mode application that enumerates all registered device interfaces.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Building INTERFACEENUM</h3>

<p>To build InterfaceEnum.EXE, follow the <a
href="..\..\wdmbook.htm#usermodebuild">general instructions for building
user-mode samples</a></p>

<h3>Testing INTERFACEENUM</h3>

<p>Execute InterfaceEnum.EXE from a command prompt. It will enumerate all the
registered device interfaces on your computer. For each interface, it will
report the friendly names of all devices that have registered that interface.</p>

<h3>What to look for</h3>
<p>InterfaceEnum.cpp uses several SetupDiXxx functions to enumerate instances of a great many
registered interfaces.</p>
