<h2>The FILEIO Sample</h2>

<p>The FILEIO Sample accompanies Chapter 3 and illustrates how to perform file
I/O operations in Windows XP and Windows 98/Me.</p>

<p>The sample includes two components:</p>

<ul >
 <li>FILEIO.SYS (SYS subdirectory) is a WDM driver for a non-existent hardware device. </li>
 <li>TEST.EXE (TEST subdirectory) is a test program that calls FILEIO.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Building FILEIO</h3>

<p>To build FILEIO.SYS, you need to have installed the Windows Millennium DDK
along with the Windows XP DDK. Follow the <a href="..\..\wdmbook.htm#wdmbuild">general
instructions for building a WDM sample</a>.<span style='color:red'> </span>The
Microsoft Visual C++ project file is named FILEIO.DSP. <span style='color:red'>Unfortunately,
you cannot use the BUILD utility for this sample program because BUILD is
unable to cope with modules that have different compile options than other
modules in the project, and FILEIO98.CPP requires special options.</span></p>

<p>To build TEST.EXE, follow the <a href="..\..\wdmbook.htm#usermodebuild">general
instructions for building user-mode samples</a></p>

<h3>Testing FILEIO</h3>

<p>Install the FILEIO.SYS driver. Follow the general instructions for using <a
href="..\..\wdmbook.htm#fastinst">FastInst</a> in Windows XP or Windows 98/Me.
The INF file is named SYS\FILEIO.INF. Windows 98/Me may prompt your for the
location of FILEIO.JNK, which is in the project directory itself.</p>

<p>During initialization, the driver will read the contents of the file
FILEIO.JNK from the Drivers directory. Thereafter, open a command prompt and
execute the TEST.EXE program in the TEST\DEBUG subdirectory. TEST will report
the file data read by the driver.</p>

<p>This sample illustrates how you can do file I/O operations in a driver
without needing separate binaries for Windows XP/Xp and Windows 98/Me/Me.
Microsoft prefers that you ship separate binaries, however. If you elect to do
that, you would (obviously) need to remove the runtime test for the platform
you're using and conditionally compile one or the other version of the file I/O
functions.</p>

<h3>Special Note</h3>
This sample requires WDMSTUB.SYS in
Windows 98/Me. If you copy the FILEIO routines to your own project,
be sure that you ship WDMSTUB.SYS along with your driver. Bear in mind that WDMSTUB requires a royalty-free
redistribution license from me. (WDMSTUB is actually only needed because the
Win2K version of SetFilePosition calls ZwSetInformationFile.)

<h3>What to look for</h3>
<p>FILEIO is less a sample and more a collection of routines you can copy into your own drivers
in order to do file I/O in a cross-platform compatible way. <b>driver.h</b> declares the interface
to these functions. <b>fileio.cpp</b> and <b>fileio98.cpp</b> contain the implementations.</p>
