<H2>The SCATGATH Sample</H2>
<P>The SCATGATH Sample accompanies Chapter 7 and illustrates how to program a DMA transfer for a PCI bus-mastering device having scatter/gather capability.</P>
<P>The sample includes one component:</P>

<UL>
<LI>SCATGATH.SYS is a WDM driver for a non-existent hardware device. </LI></UL>

<H3>Building SCATGATH</H3>
<P>To build SCATGATH.SYS, follow the <A HREF="../../wdmbook.htm#wdmbuild">general instructions for building a WDM sample</A>. The Microsoft Visual C++ project file is named SCATGATH.DSP.</P>
<H3>Testing SCATGATH</H3>
<P>SCATGATH doesn’t have a test program. I put it into the book in order to verify that the code examples used in the text would actually compile successfully.
A reader reports that he copied this sample without important change into a driver and found that it
worked correctly.</P>

<h3>What to look for</h3>
<p><b>ReadWrite.cpp</b> contains the routines used for DMA using a scatter/gather list built by
the system. Look at the routines named <b>StartIo</b>, <b>DmaExecutionRoutine</b>, <b>OnInterrupt,</b>
and <b>DpcForIsr</b>.</p>
