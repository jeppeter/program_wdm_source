<H2>The MAKENAME Sample</H2>
<P>The MAKENAME Sample accompanies Chapter 15 and illustrates how to generate a unique friendly name during a device installation. </P>
<P>The sample includes one component: </P>

<UL>
<LI>MAKENAME.DLL is a DLL for use as part of a device installation procedure. </LI></UL>

<H3>Building MAKENAME</H3>
<P>To build MAKENAME.DLL, follow the <A HREF="../../wdmbook.htm#usermodebuild">general instructions for building user-mode programs</A>. The Microsoft Visual C++ project file is named MAKENAME.DSP. </P>
<H3>Testing MAKENAME</H3>
<P>You can test MAKENAME as follows. First, select a device that doesn't already have a friendly name in its hardware registry key. Then open a command prompt and execute a command like the following one:</P>
<CODE><P>C:&gt;<U>rundll32 makename,MakeName "DeviceDesc" "FriendlyName (%d)"</P>
</U></CODE><P>Here, DeviceDesc is the device description, exactly as it appears in the target device's hardware registry key, and FriendlyName is a friendly name string. To make up a completely fictitious example, suppose you've got an Acme brand toaster whose DeviceDesc is "Acme model 90240". A plausible experiment to make would be:</P>
<CODE><P>C:&gt;<U>rundll32 makename,MakeName "Acme model 90240" "Acme Toaster (%d)"</P>
</U></CODE><H3>Using MAKENAME</H3>
<P>MAKENAME.DLL is intended for use in a RUNDLL32 command that you would install into the RunOnce registry key via statements in your INF file. Your INF file could, for example, contain the following: </P>
<CODE><P>[DestinationDirs]<BR>
MakeNameCopyFiles=11<BR>
<BR>
[DeviceList]<BR>
"Acme model 90240"=DriverInstall,*WCO1204<BR>
