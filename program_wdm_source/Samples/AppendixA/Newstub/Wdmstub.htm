<h2>The New WDMSTUB Sample</h2>

<p>The New WDMSTUB Sample accompanies Appendix A and illustrates how to supply
stubs for kernel-mode support functions that would otherwise be missing from
Windows 98. This sample was added in Service Pack 4 for the 1st edition.</p>

<p>The sample includes one component:</p>

<ul>
 <li>WDMSTUB.SYS is a lower filter driver for use with Windows 98.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Building WDMSTUB</h3>

<p>To build WDMSTUB.SYS, follow the 
<a href="..\..\wdmbook.htm#wdmbuild">general instructions for building a WDM
sample</a>. The project file is named WDMSTUB.DSP. The build settings
depend on your having set the 98DDK environment variable to the directory
where you installed the Windows 98 DDK. Depending on which version of the DDK
you have, you may need to adjust the include or library paths in the project
settings.</p>

<h3>Testing WDMSTUB</h3>

<p>You use WDMSTUB.SYS as a lower filter driver for any WDM driver that calls
the functions it exports. Simply modify your regular INF file to include
additional statements, such as the ones shown in red here:</p>

<code>
<pre>
[SourceDisksFiles]
yourdvr.sys=1
<span style='color:red'>wdmstub.sys=1</span>

[DriverInstall]
CopyFiles=DriverCopyFiles
AddReg=DriverAddReg

[DriverCopyFiles]
yourdvr.sys,,,2
<span style='color:red'>wdmstub.sys,,,2</span>

[DriverAddReg]
HKR,,DevLoader,,*ntkern
HKR,,NTMPDriver,,"<span style='color:red'>wdmstub.sys,</span>,yourdvr.sys"
</pre>
</code>

<p>These changes cause WDMSTUB.SYS to be installed as a lower filter driver for
YOURDVR.SYS. Windows 98 will load WDMSTUB.SYS before it attempts to load
YOURDVR.SYS. The DriverEntry function in WDMSTUB defines a number of
kernel-mode support functions that are missing from Windows 98 and Windows 98
Second Edition. Since WDMSTUB defines these functions <i>before</i> the system
attempts to load your driver, you can install your driver without requiring a
reboot.</p>

<h3>Redistributing WDMSTUB</h3>

<p>WDMSTUB is an exception to the blanket license to use the sample programs
for this book. The author will grant a royalty-free license to anyone to
redistribute WDMSTUB as part of a WDM driver package. The license will,
however, include conditions designed to insure the consistency and quality of
WDMSTUB on end user machines. Send e-mail to
<a href="mailto:waltoney@oneysoft.com">waltoney@oneysoft.com</a> for information
about obtaining this conditional license.</p>

<p>Note: A special license is required even if you ship WDMSTUB under a
different name. This driver includes special checking to make sure that it does
not unload while some other vendor’s driver might be using it, and the special
license will insure that you preserve that checking.</p>

<h3>What to look for</h3>
<p>WDMSTUB is primarily a production driver rather than a sample. If you want to see how to define
your own exports, look at the function named <b>DefineStubs</b> in <b>wdmstub.cpp</b>. <i>Please
don't write your own version of WDMSTUB to export some special function you need in your driver.
Write me (<a href="mailto:waltoney@oneysoft.com">waltoney@oneysoft.com</a>) instead.</i></p>
