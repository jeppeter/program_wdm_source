WHAT'S ON THIS CD?
==================

This companion disc contains the source code for the sample
programs presented in Programming the Microsoft Windows Driver
Model, Second Edition. Open the file SAMPLES\WDMBOOK.HTM in your
Web browser for an index to the samples and an explanation of the
included tools.


HOW TO USE THE CD
=================

To use this CD, insert the disc into your CD-ROM drive; a starting
menu should appear automatically. If AutoRun is disabled on your
machine, run StartCD.exe in the root folder to launch this menu.


Installing the Practice Files
-----------------------------

To copy all of the sample code onto your hard disk, run the
SETUP.EXE program in the \Samples folder and follow the instructions 
that appear on the screen. The sample code requires a minimum of
32 MB of hard disk space. Setup will ask your permission to add some
environment variables to your system. The build procedure for the
samples relies on these environment variables. Setup will also ask
for permission for several other tasks such as creating context
menus for file types.

To remove the practice files from your hard disk, select "WDMBOOK
Samples" from Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel and click
Change/Remove.
